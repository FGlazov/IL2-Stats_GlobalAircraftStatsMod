Version 1.0.0:

- Initial version.

Version 1.0.1

- Retroactive computation was not starting in some cases. This has been fixed.

Version 1.0.2

- Prevent crash of stats process if mod is run without any tours or sorties present.
- Fix bug with killboard and elo computation, where it was taking AI shotdown by aircraft turrets into account.

Version 1.0.3

- Compatibility patch for tanks updated to work with latest version.

Version 1.1.0

- Official support for Flying Circus. I.e. the jabo filters should now work properly for Flying Circus planes.

Version 1.1.1

- Fix error introduced in last version which prevented updates.

Version 1.1.2

- Fix error which caused stats process to terminate after encountering a plane damaged by the B-25.

Version 1.2.0

- New pages: Show aircraft stats per player.
- Add Offensive/Defensive ammo breakdowns (when Ammo Breakdown module is active in IL-2 Stats enchancements.) This does not work retroactively.
- Add "Fitler below" option for aircraft killboard. You can now check e.g. Spitfire with boost vs BF 109 K-4 without boost matchup.
- Add new data point "Plane lethality (no assists)"
- Add new data points "Aircraft lost to accidents/AA" and "Deaths due to accidents/AA". This is calculated retroactively for old data.
- Show total number of instances next to percent datapoints. E.g. instead of showing Deaths: 54%, show Deaths: 54% (132), where 132 is the nr of deaths that occured.
- Fix bug where "Fighter Score" was not being translated into Russian.
- Fix rendering issue where "Filter by" was jumping on Aircraft Rankings page when sorting.
- Update to version 1.2.49 of IL-2 Stats.

Version 1.2.1

- Update to version 1.2.50 of IL-2 Stats.

Version 1.2.2:

- Fix bug introduced in 1.2.0 which caused turret kills to be counted twice towards elo, and also twice towards the aircraft killboard.
- Fix bug in retroactive computations where accident/aa deaths/lost aircraft were only being processed for not-filtered buckets. 

Version 1.2.3

- Fix bug where player killboard loses were not being incremented in retroactive computations.
- Fix calculation bug where some deaths were being listed as accidents, even though they were not accidents.

Version 1.2.4

- Fix bug where numbers in avg hits to kill/aircraft lost were being garbled. In particular, ShVAK (HE) and ShVAK(AP) were being mixed up.

Version 1.2.5 

- Update to 1.2.51 of IL2 Stats.

Version 1.2.6:

- Fix yet another bug which caused turret kills in killboards to double.

Version 1.2.7:

- Recompute fields deaths/aircraft lost due to accidents/aa. This will fix the doubled data here.

Version 1.2.8:

- Recompute elo, plane, pilot lethality, and aircraft killboards. This will fix data polluted by a previous bug which doubled turret kills, causing calculation problems.
- Give a status update every time 5000 sorties are computed in background jobs.

Version 1.2.9:

- Fix bug where not all loses in retroactive compute of player killboards were being counted.
- Recompute loses in player killboards if they were computed before.

Version 1.3.0

- Add Portuguese translations.
- New page: Each aircraft has a new tab "Aircraft Pilot Rankings", which shows the best players for that aircraft.
- Change "Rating" field in Player Aircraft to now be "Position in Rating".
- Add new fields "Best air kill/ground kill/score streak". Note that these streaks reset only when you fly that aircraft, e.g. if you die in between p-51 sorties it doesn't reset your p-51 streak. These fields are clickable with a link to the player!
- Add new fields "Current air kill/ground kill/score streak" for player aircraft stats. Like above, only reset when you die in that aircraft.
- Add new fields "Max AK/GK/Score in one sortie". They are clickable with a link to the sortie!
- Add new fields "Kills" and "Ground kills" to Aircraft Rankings and Pilot Aircraft Overview pages.
- Do not count AI kills towards Plane Lethality (No assists).
- Do not count sorties where the plane took off twice (and thus likely rearmed) or the pilot bailed out towards accuracy stats (the nr bullets shot is bugged in both of these cases due to bugs in the game logs). This also applies retroactively.
- Log update to console when doing background jobs for every 5000 sorties processed.
